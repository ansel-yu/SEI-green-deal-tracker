CBAM,Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism,Sweden,,"The CBAM regulation was adopted by the Swedish Parliament and came into force on the 1st of July 2024. The Swedish Government and national authorities already laid the groundwork for preparing for the enforcement of the CBAM. The process involved various working groups and frequent consultations with the European Commission, especially after CBAM’s operationalization to resolve technical issues regarding the IT systems for reporting. The system will expand eventually with an overall evaluation taking place toward the end of 2025. Some policy issues that need to be addressed are already identified. While much of the groundwork for registering importers and preparing the system has been completed by mid-2024, the first round of CBAM certificate submissions has yet to take place. Authorities anticipate a significant administrative burden once the certificate processing begins.","The key roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the CBAM are divided among several authorities. The Ministry of Finance acts as the coordinator of the enforcement. In addition, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with overseeing compliance and enforcement due to its expertise in validating CO2 emissions under systems like the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). This role requires an expanded mandate, which was achieved through new legislative proposals. Additionally, the EPA received funding to hire extra personnel and conduct outreach activities to inform businesses of their CBAM obligations. Alongside the Ministry of Finance and the EPA, the Swedish Customs also played a critical role in the operationalization of CBAM.","Several factors influenced the implementation process, both positively and negatively. One key challenge stemmed from initial negotiations between the Commission and Member States regarding the division of labour. Member States initially resisted taking on the responsibility for managing the CBAM data depository and certificate issuance due to the administrative and financial burdens involved. Ultimately, the Commission agreed to handle these functions, allowing Member States to focus on implementation without having to establish complex IT systems. This decision facilitates a more efficient rollout of the CBAM, especially for Sweden, where the EPA could adapt existing IT systems used for the EU ETS with only minor adjustments.
However, the negotiations on the division of responsibilities also delayed the preparation time for Member States, leaving Sweden with only 4-5 months to fully prepare before the transitional phase began. This short timeframe made it challenging to adequately inform importers of their new obligations. Additionally, determining the appropriate roles and responsibilities among Swedish authorities proved time-consuming, requiring the expansion of the EPA’s mandate and the establishment of new administrative structures.
The Commission's support through consultations, capacity-building seminars, and IT guidance also enabled smoother implementation. These efforts provided clarity on the technical aspects of the CBAM system and helped Sweden to align its national processes with EU regulations. Nonetheless, an unforeseen issue emerging in Sweden was the underestimation of the number of businesses subject to the CBAM regulations, initially thought to be fewer than the actual figure of 5,000. This led to an administrative backlog, with some businesses still not fully informed of their responsibilities.
Future concerns for Sweden's national authorities relate to the low threshold for CBAM exemption and the difficulty in obtaining accurate data on embedded emissions from exporting countries. The current €150 threshold for CBAM exemptions could create administrative problems, as private citizens importing goods for non-commercial purposes would still need to declare their embedded emissions, a requirement that Swedish Customs systems are not equipped to handle. This could overwhelm the EPA as they track and notify these individuals. Additionally, importers face challenges in acquiring reliable data on embedded emissions from manufacturers in some countries, particularly where production lines are less developed or where local regulations do not require such disclosures. In many cases, manufacturers may be unwilling to provide this information, or their governments may not support the objectives of EU policies.","For the CBAM to be effectively implemented, cooperation from manufacturers and governments in exporting countries is crucial. These countries need to create conducive policy environments and reporting systems for monitoring embedded CO2 emissions. While some nations may be willing to comply to gain access to the EU market, others may view the CBAM as an unfair burden, especially low-income countries where establishing such monitoring systems could be prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for countries to perceive CBAM as ""green imperialism"" or ""green perfectionism,"" which could further hinder cooperation. To address these concerns, the European Commission has invested heavily in diplomatic efforts, consulting with international trade partners and exploring ways to mitigate their reservations. These continued diplomatic efforts will be vital to ensuring the long-term success of the CBAM globally. ","In conclusion, while the implementation of CBAM in Sweden has made significant progress, the process has faced both logistical and policy-related challenges. Ongoing support from the European Commission, along with diplomatic outreach, will be critical in ensuring smooth implementation and overcoming hurdles related to international cooperation and data collection.","Administrative burden, Data challenges, External factors, Insufficient time, Unclear ownership","Existing capabilities, Strong EU-Support","October 29, 2024",In progress,Industry

EED,Revised Energy Efficiency Directive,Sweden,,"The Swedish government began the process of implementing the revised EED. The Directive requires several legislative changes by 2025. This process involves reviewing existing legislation and introducing new laws where necessary. Progress on the implementation is estimated to be between 20-40%, with many assignments already submitted to the respective agencies. A key focus of the implementation is addressing energy poverty.  Moreover, some legislative proposals are already under review, and by autumn 2024 it is expected that 50% of the implementation progress will be achieved. A major concern remaining is the capacity of the Swedish Parliament to handle the additional legislative workload, which could slow down the overall process. ","The key agencies charged with the assignments of identifying how to implement the revised EED into national law are the Swedish Energy Agency and the National Board for Housing, Buildings, and Planning. Currently, there is only one additional assignment in the pipeline before all the articles needing to be addressed are covered. The Swedish Energy Agency had the particular task of creating a definition of energy poverty that can later be included in the legislative changes. Sweden has opted to manage energy poverty through social policy instruments, and the Swedish government successfully negotiated for this approach to be recognized in the revised EED. The actual policy implementations are processed by the government’s legal secretaries that oversee much of the preparatory work. They have been organizing public consultations on various legislative packages, with the goal of completing the implementation by autumn 2025. ","Several factors have helped Sweden progress with the implementation of the revised EED, particularly the country’s well-established policy framework for energy efficiency. Some of the articles in the directive align closely with existing Swedish laws, meaning that only minor adjustments are required for compliance. For example, Article 11, which addresses energy audits, and Article 7, which expands energy efficiency requirements to include regional and local authorities, are largely covered by existing laws. The ""energy efficiency first"" principle outlined in Article 3 is another area where Sweden has been able to leverage its existing frameworks. Authorities plan to incorporate this principle into the environmental assessment process, known as Miljökonsekvensbeskrivning, which will simplify its implementation. 
Additionally, Sweden’s experience with the previous EED revision in 2018 has been instrumental in speeding up the current process. During the 2018 revision, comprehensive assessments and consultations were conducted, generating knowledge that is now proving invaluable in implementing the updated directive. This has saved time and effort in several areas, allowing Sweden to address certain articles more quickly.
However, despite these enabling factors, significant challenges have arisen during the implementation process. One of the main hurdles is the time-consuming nature of Sweden’s legislative process. Any new laws or amendments must go through a series of assessments and public consultations before they can take effect. This is particularly challenging for more complex articles in the revised EED, where entirely new legislation is required. Once the new law is drafted, it will need approval from the Parliament. Currently, the Parliament is dealing with a heavy legislative workload which could delay the approval of new laws and amendments necessary for the EED’s implementation. Also, other agencies tasked with providing information and feedback on the directive’s implementation face capacity constraints potentially prolonging the implementation process.
Sweden’s recent presidency of the EU Council further complicated the situation. The presidency stretched government resources and created capacity constraints, delaying some of the early-stage preparatory work for the EED. Moreover, the timeline for the revised EED has proven less than ideal compared to other EU directives, adding to the challenges of meeting the 2025 deadline.Political changes have also affected the implementation process. The current government responsible for implementing the revised EED, is different from the one originally negotiating the directive. This required a renewed political buy-in, as the new government must align its policies with the EED’s requirements. While internal processes have continued without major issues, gaining political support has proven more difficult.   ","Much of the preparatory work needed for implementing the revised EED depends on the capacity of government agencies. While the government can request information from national authorities, formal assignments are often required when agencies face resource limitations. These constraints, along with the complexities of the directive itself, continue to present challenges as Sweden works to meet the 2025 deadline. Especially the laws governing energy audits require adjustments to align with the directive’s new focus on energy use and updated thresholds. Work on these adjustments is ongoing with the aim of implementing them the following year.","In conclusion, while Sweden has made steady progress in implementing the revised EED, challenges remain. The country has benefited from pre-existing frameworks, institutional knowledge, and its experience with previous EED revisions. However, lengthy legislative processes, political shifts, and capacity limitations in both government agencies and Parliament have slowed progress. Despite these obstacles, Sweden remains committed to fulfilling its obligations under the EED by 2025, but the road ahead will require careful navigation of these structural and procedural hurdles.",Administrative burden,Existing capabilities,"October 8, 2024",Not started,

LULUCF,"Revised Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry ",Sweden,,"Sweden had begun developing strategies and policy measures to meet the 2030 targets under the LULUCF sector even before the revised regulation was adopted. This effort was initiated through the formation of a cross-parliamentary committee (Miljömålsberedningen). The committee's findings, including the adopted amendments to the LULUCF regulation, were presented to the government, which is now responsible for implementing these recommendations. Although the revised LULUCF regulation does not necessitate changes to Swedish national legislation, additional policy measures will be required to achieve the targets","The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had been tasked with reviewing the LULUCF revisions and preparing itself and other relevant authorities for the new requirements. The EPA conducted cross-agency consultations to ensure a coordinated approach, publishing its key findings in September 2023. Additionally, the Swedish government introduced provisions in the 2024 budget to strengthen efforts to re-wet wetlands aligned with the LULUCF’s revision. The government also responded to revisions concerning corrective action reports, which had previously been a major obstacle to Sweden’s support for LULUCF updates. ","The revised LULUCF offers several enabling factors that support Sweden's implementation efforts. One key advantage is the flexibility embedded in the LULUCF framework, which allows EU Member States to purchase emission reductions from other states through carbon credits. This flexibility has been especially important for Sweden, where active forest management is a critical tool for balancing economic and environmental priorities.
Another factor facilitating LULUCF implementation is Sweden’s whole-of-government approach. Cross-agency collaboration has enabled more efficient preparatory work, particularly in the coordination between the Environmental Protection Agency and other authorities. Moreover, Sweden has been able to leverage existing frameworks for environmental inventory work, including methods like plot sampling, which are already in place.
On the other hand, some issues encountered during the implementation phase are, for example, the tension between short- and long-term carbon sink objectives. Sweden emphasizes the benefits of actively managing forests to maximize carbon absorption, arguing that harvesting mature trees and planting new ones maintains higher long-term carbon sinks. This approach, which also supports the low-carbon economy through biomaterials production, contrasts with views that advocate preserving mature forests for biodiversity and ecosystem health. These conflicting priorities create a major challenge for the cross-party parliamentary committee, as they must balance economic and environmental objectives.
Another significant challenge is Sweden’s delay in submitting living biomass sample plot data to the European Commission. While emissions inventory data have a two-year time lag, biomass data submissions are delayed by approximately five years. To address this issue, the EPA has been tasked with exploring the use of satellite imagery and other technologies to improve data collection. While satellite data may help in some cases, it is unlikely to replace certain types of data, such as tree ring analysis, which are essential for accurate forest assessments.
In addition to data challenges, Sweden’s forests must be adapted to cope with climate change. National authorities will need to take greater steps to incorporate climate resilience into forest management practices, including planting tree species better suited to warmer conditions and more resistant to pests.","A broader challenge for Sweden is the high level of uncertainty posed by changing climate patterns. Unpredictable weather conditions make it difficult to forecast forest growth accurately, complicating efforts to meet LULUCF targets. Over the past five to six years, weather trends have negatively impacted forest growth, creating uncertainty around the gaps in reaching carbon sink targets. This variability, largely outside the control of policymakers, introduces a significant element of unpredictability into LULUCF planning and implementation.","In conclusion, Sweden has made steady progress in implementing the revised LULUCF, benefitting from established frameworks, cross-agency cooperation, and policy flexibilities. However, challenges related to conflicting environmental and economic priorities, data collection delays, and climate adaptation remain significant hurdles. The Swedish government will need to continue balancing these factors while adapting its forest management practices to ensure compliance with the revised LULUCF and contribute to the EU’s broader climate goals.",,,,Not started,

JTF,"Just Transition Fund Regulation ",Sweden,,"Sweden has successfully established and operationalized the Just Transition Fund (JTF) following the EU’s approval in August 2022. The Swedish government promptly set up the national framework and issued several rounds of funding calls. Although the JTF does not require new national legislation, the Swedish government has undertaken significant efforts to implement the policy.
Regarding the green-rewarding mechanism where countries receive more funding based on their progress towards set carbon targets, the government uses performance indicators such as training recipients and small business aid, to measure progress. However, CO2 emissions reductions linked to JTF-funded projects will only become evident in the coming years. Sweden reports its progress on these indicators to the EU Commission multiple times a year, with a mid-term evaluation scheduled for March 2024, halfway through the program period (2021–2027).
","Sweden allocated responsibility for the JTF to Tillväxtverket, a government agency with experience administering other EU funds such as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Moreover, Sweden chose to administer the JTF at the national level, diverging from the EU Commission’s recommendation to implement the fund regionally. Funding was allocated to decarbonizing heavy industries, such as steel and cement, located within three regions—Västerbotten, Gotland, and Norrbotten. Regional authorities have so far limited flexibility in using the funds for public sector-led initiatives. For this reason, an oversight committee with regional representatives was established to ensure that JTF implementation aligns with EU requirements, including regional involvement. Nonetheless, national authorities are responsible for ensuring that Sweden complies with EU JTF legislation and remains eligible for funding.","Sweden’s enabling factors are manifold. First, the fund shares many administrative similarities with the ERDF, allowing Tillväxtverket to leverage existing protocols, procedures, and IT systems. As a result, establishing the JTF was relatively straightforward, requiring minimal adjustments to current frameworks. This administrative continuity simplified the fund’s rollout, ensuring that Sweden could efficiently manage and operate the JTF.
Sweden was also well-prepared to implement the JTF due to its strong national climate frameworks, which had been agreed upon by parliament before the fund's introduction. Sectors such as steel and cement had already developed decarbonization roadmaps, and the different regions had established their own climate strategies. This readiness positioned Sweden to develop JTF projects quickly. The challenge for Sweden is ensuring that heavy industry transitions smoothly while maintaining competitiveness and preventing job losses.
However, several hindering factors have created bottlenecks in the JTF’s operation, particularly concerning EU state aid rules. Although the JTF allows governments to support large CO2-emitting industries in their fossil fuels phase out, EU state aid rules prohibit direct funding to industries without a competitive process. This legislative conflict between the JTF and EU state aid regulations has caused delays in project approval, as Swedish authorities have had to request exceptions from the Commission.
Another significant challenge is the short timeframe for spending the JTF funds, which primarily come from the Next-Generation EU instrument. Seventy-five percent of the funding must be allocated and fully delivered by the end of 2026, creating tight deadlines for project implementation. Industries face additional hurdles, such as making investment decisions, securing environmental permits, procuring green electricity, and addressing indigenous rights. The ambitious timeline may prevent the JTF from achieving its full objectives within the set period.
Moreover, the JTF requires significant involvement from regional authorities, which conflicts with Swedens’ administration at nation level. 
","This fund is particularly impactful for Eastern European member states, where coal-dependent regions face significant transitions. However, disbursement of JTF funds is conditional on countries actively phasing out fossil fuels. member states communicate their progress in this regard through the SFC platform, managed by DG REGIO, alongside other cohesion funds. In many Central and Eastern European countries, the JTF is administered at the regional level, meaning regions must build administrative capacities from scratch. While this can be cumbersome, it ensures that the fund is directly accessible to the regions most in need of support during the transition.","In conclusion, while Sweden’s implementation of the JTF was facilitated by its existing frameworks and climate plans, challenges remain, particularly around EU state aid rules and tight timelines. Sweden's focus on decarbonizing heavy industries demonstrates its commitment to a just transition, though balancing industrial competitiveness and climate objectives will continue to be a key focus in the coming years.",,,,Not started,
